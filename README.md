MangaBox is a multiplatform, web based client for <a href="https://komga.org">Komga</a>, the manga and comics media server.		

## Supported platforms

- Web/PWA - Deploy MangaBox on a personal web server, use it in the browser or as a PWA on your device.

- Electron desktop application
	- Windows (x86 and ARM)
	- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
	- Linux (AppImage)

- Capacitor mobile application
	- Android APK - Debug APK, you can manually install on Android devices
	- iOS/ipadOS .ipa - Unsigned app for Apple devices, you can sideload it with AltStore or similar
	- iOS/ipadOS .app - App bundle for testing on XCode simulator (universal binary)

## Installation notes

- To deploy the web verions just download the "web" release artifact and unpack it in a "mangabox" folder on your web server. Because of CORS limitation by default MangaBox will work only if it's on the same location as your komga server.

- Electron version is not limited by CORS and it will work with any Komga server.

- The macOS binaries are not signed, so they won't run by default. You can allow them to run on Intel macs by right-click/open but on Apple Silicon you'll need to ad-hoc sign the binary. This is a simple bash script that will do the hard work for you:

  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  app="$1"
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "${app}"
  find "${app}/Contents" -type f -exec codesign --force --timestamp --verify --verbose --sign - "{}" \;
  codesign --force --timestamp --verify --verbose --sign - "${app}"
  ```

	Just chmod +x the script and run it with the .app file path as argument.

- Mobile versions are not signed, you can sideload the Android apk on your device, and you can sideload the iOS/ipadOS version using a developer tool like AltStore which will self sign and renew the signature every 7 days.
