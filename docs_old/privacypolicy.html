	<h1>MangaBox Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><em>Last updated: October 2025</em></p>

	<p>
		MangaBox (“the App”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.
		This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles data while providing its features and services.
	</p>

	<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
	<p>
		MangaBox <u>does not collect or transmit personal information</u> to any external server.
		The App connects to your own Komga server instance to display your library content.
		The App stores certain data locally on your device to provide its functionality:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Session cookies:</strong> Used to maintain your authenticated session with your Komga server. These cookies are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to any third-party service.</li>
		<li><strong>Cached data:</strong> User settings are cached to Local Storage for offline use. Metadata and thumbnails from your Komga library may be cached in local storage (IndexedDB) to improve performance and offline access.</li>
		<li><strong>Offline content:</strong> Books you choose to download are stored in the App's private data storage area.</li>
		<li><strong>User customization:</strong> App settings and optional images you select for library customization are shared with your Komga server to be available on different clients and remain stored locally on your device.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
	<p>
		MangaBox does not collect analytics, advertising data, or share any personal or usage data with third parties.
	</p>

	<h2>Permissions</h2>
	<p>
		The App may request access to local storage or media files to allow you to download and manage your library, and to select images for customization.
		No other device permissions are required or used.
	</p>

	<h2>Data Security</h2>
	<p>
		All cached and downloaded content is stored securely on your device's local storage.
		You can delete this data at any time by:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Clearing your library custom thumbnails</li>
		<li>Logging out from the server to clear local cache on your device</li>
		<li>Deleting downloaded books to clear all metadata and media</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>
		MangaBox is not directed at children under 13. The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
	</p>

	<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any updates will be posted on this page with the revised date.
	</p>

	<h2>Contact</h2>
	<p>
		If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer at:
